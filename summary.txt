The messages will be "unwrapped" by sculptor Richard Wentworth, who is responsible for decorating the tree with broken plates and light bulbs.  A Christmas tree that can receive text messages has been unveiled at London's Tate Britain art gallery. The plain green Norway spruce is displayed in the gallery's foyer. It is the 17th year that the gallery has invited an artist to dress their Christmas tree.
